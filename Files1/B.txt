technical innovation and refinement
• construction, configuration and styling
• methods of production, and manufacturing systems.
To the layman, the most obvious aspects of progress are technical innovations and styling
changes, but from a professional engineering viewpoint, the major achievements lie as much in
the areas of refinement and systems of manufacture. Innovations can be important in giving
manufacturers a competitive advantage, but new ideas often make their debut many decades
before they are widely adopted. It is the processes of refinement and production development
that make new technical features reliable and cheap enough for use in mass-produced vehicles.
