1.2 Innovations and inventions
Engineering history is bedevilled by rival and sometimes false claims to particular inventions.
In reality, innovative developments have often been the work of several different engineers
working in parallel but quite independently, and the recognized inventor is simply one whose
name is well known, or who has been championed for nationalistic reasons. Many apparently
new inventions are, in any case, simply adaptations from different technologies. The differential
mechanism, for example, was used by watchmakers before being adapted for automotive purposes.
It is frequently difficult to trace the earliest examples of the use of a particular device or
mechanism. J. Ickx, 1992, describes how the Bollées (father and two sons) invented or adapted
an amazing array of devices in the late 19th century, including all-round independent suspension,
and power steering (originally applied to steam-powered vehicles). In 1894, the younger Amédée
